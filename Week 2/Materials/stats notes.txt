Types of Descriptive Statistics:
1. Measure of Central Tendency
	Mean
	Mode
	Median

2. Measure of Variability
	Range
	Variance
	Standard Deviation

Data
 -Categorical
 -Numerical

Normal Distribution:

Emperical Rule
68% of data fall in 1st S.D
95% of data falls in 2nd S.d
99.7% of data falls in 3rd S.d
Any point aftre this  3rd sigma is outlier

Distortion
1.Skewness
2.Kurtosis

1.Skewness
	1.Right Skewed
		Mean>Median>Mode
	2. Left Skewed
		Mode>Median>Mean
		
	-0.5 to 0.5 ---nearly symmetrical
	-1 to -0.5
	      or 	---Slightly Skewed
	0.5 to 1
	less than -1 or greater than 1 extremely Skewed

Kurtosis- It measures the peakedness of the probability Distribution

Scaling	
	1.Normalisation
		0-1
		MinMaxScalar() from Scikit Learn

	2. Standardization
		Mean=0
		S.D=1
		-1 to 1
		StandardScalar() from ScikitLearn

	3. Robust Scalar- It scales down according to InterQuatile Range

Z Score- Indicates how many Standard deviation an element is far from mean
	Z<0------Element is less than Mean
	Z=0------Element is equal to Mean
	Z<0 -----Element is greater than Mean
Hypothesis
	Simple
	Composite

P Value- Smallest level of Significance at which the null hypothesis will be rejected
	If P value is greater than alpha we do not reject the null hypothsis
	if p value is smaller than alpha we reject the null hypothesis
